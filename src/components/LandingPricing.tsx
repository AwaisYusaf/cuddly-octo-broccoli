          Affordability is a cornerstone of Youâ€™ve Got a Friend. While
          conventional rates for Life Coaches or Counselors are typically
          $100/hr or more, we offer a much more affordable approach. We
          understand that financial constraints should not hinder your access to
          support. Our Talking/Coaching packages start at just $30/hr when you
          go for just one hour at a time, however it drops down significantly in
          price per session as you go with the larger packages.
          <br />
          Whether you want to dip your toes in the water with the1-hour option
          first or jump right in and sign up for our 25 hour package, we offer
          you the flexibility to choose the package that suits your needs best.
