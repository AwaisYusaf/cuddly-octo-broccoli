          well-being. Research shows that prolonged loneliness can lead to
          increased risks of heart disease, depression, anxiety, and even
          mortality. Despite its prevalence, society often overlooks the
          significance of loneliness as a serious health concern. The {"You've"}{" "}

          effects of loneliness. Their service aims to provide a supportive
